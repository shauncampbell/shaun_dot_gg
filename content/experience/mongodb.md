As a Consulting Engineer, I took part in various different engagements all of which was customer facing.
My customers were all over Europe and was mostly on-site though remote engagements did happen from time to
time.

One common engagement would be to spend 2 or 3 days delivering various training courses to customer's staff
and then spend the remainder of the week helping them to perform various tasks such as:
* configure their software
* design an appropriate schema for their problem
* use the client libraries in an efficient way to solve their issues.

Other engagements were more bespoke, where I'd visit the same customer many times over several months and attempt
to solve whatever performance/schema issues they were experiencing at that point. Many of these customers were large
banks and financial institutions processing large volumes of data and pushing their hardware to its limits.

This role required me not so much to write code, but to read code in many different languages. In fact, not just
different programming languages, but often the variables and function names were written literally in a different language.
