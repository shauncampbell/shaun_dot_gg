Starting initially as a Graduate Software Engineer when it was called Memex Technology Ltd and based in East Kilbride -
I worked on a wide range of projects during my tenure. In my early years, I worked extensively on site  on a collaborative
project with a large UK Police Force to ensure server side upgrades went smoothly and to test out disaster recovery and data
ingestion worked smoothly. When I wasn't on site with the customer, I would be working on features and bugs based on my experience
on site. I would be routinely working between C based server side applications, with newer Java web services running on top and also
C# based UI extensions.

Later I transitioned into performance testing role where I worked not only to find bottlenecks in our systems but to recommend and
implement some of those fixes as well. During this role, not only was I writing testing agents but also writing the start of what
would become an automated testing framework for the platform.

I spent some time working on [SAS Visual Investigator](https://www.sas.com/en_ca/software/intelligence-analytics-visual-investigator.html)
before transitioning into a new, smaller team working on what would later become [SAS Event Stream Manager](https://www.sas.com/en_ca/software/intelligence-analytics-visual-investigator.html) and
[SAS Event Stream Processing Studio](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/espcdc/5.2/espstudio/titlepage.htm). Working primarily on
the Java backend services, I did help out on the front end on occasion this was my first foray into web development using Angular.
