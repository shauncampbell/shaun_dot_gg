I joined Scout Climate when it was freshly spun out of Forum Ventures and our staff roster included just myself and
our founder and started to learn about the crazy world of government grants. The initial months of this role was spent
just trying to bring some order to the chaos in that every grant looked different, had different requirements, provided
different information, had different deadlines. Eventually though, I was able to learn enough about it to start building
an initial prototype in Svelte for the frontend and Python on the backend based on some designs we had been provided.

We later onboarded a frontend developer to spearhead the frontend development work and I took ownership mainly of the backend
development and devops tasks.

As of November 2024, we have started to grow quite quickly and it has been amazing to see our team grow; and it has me excited about
what we can achieve with more resources.
